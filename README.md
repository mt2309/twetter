Twetter
=======

A command-line twitter interface. Mostly a toy-project
for me to use twitter with, doing what I wanted it
to do.

Things it currently supports
----------------------------

* LaTeX!
* Getting mentions
* Reading tweets from stdin
* Piping input in and tweeting it
* streaming your timeline

Setup
-----

Needs an OAUTH set up, then add a config
file at ~/.twitter_info with:

consumer_key:
consumer_secret:
access_token:
access_secret:

with the fields completed.
